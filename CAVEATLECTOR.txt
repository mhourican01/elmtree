This served as a project for my Web Development module.
The conn.php file has been depopulated, as well as any personal information or URLs used in the connection.
The code has not been modified since submission. However, were I to make changes, it is in dire need of comments, 
and I have since learned not to use "SELECT *" where not all columns are required.
